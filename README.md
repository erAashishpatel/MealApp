# MealApp
Created a Meal App using HTML, CSS, &amp; Vanilla JavaScript. 

#Problem statement:
Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).


#Features:

1. Home Page:

*Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
*Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
*On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)


2. Meal Detail Page:

*Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).


3. My favourite meals Page:

*Display a list of all the favourite meals.
*Make this list persistent 
*Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
